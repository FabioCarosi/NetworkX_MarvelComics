# Marvel Graph Analysis using NetworkX

This project uses the NetworkX library to analyze a dataset of Marvel comic book characters and their appearances. The dataset includes information on comic book issues and the characters that appear in them.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/FabioCarosi/NetworkX_MarvelComics.git`
2. Run the file `marvel-network.ipynb`

## Analysis

The script will create a graph using NetworkX, with characters as nodes and comic book appearances as edges. The script will then perform various analysis on the graph, including:

- Degree centrality
- Betweenness centrality
- Closeness centrality
- Connected components
- Communities

## Results

The script will output the results of the analysis to the console, and also create a PNG image of the graph.

## Note

This project is just a demonstration of the capabilities of the NetworkX library and is not an official analysis of Marvel comic books.
